# Scenario:
# 1. Your feature branch just got merged into the TRUNK branch in the remote repo.
# 2. You want to checkout TRUNK, pull it from the remote, and delete your feature branch.
# 3. This command will do that all in one step.
#
# Example: Your TRUNK branch is 'master'
#
# $ br-clean master
#
# This switches to `master`, runs `git pull`, and deletes the branch you were on before.
